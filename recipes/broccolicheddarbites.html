        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Do you like broccoli? I LOVE, seriously love broccoli.
            Favorite way to eat it? Steamed, served with a little mayo. 
            I wish more people shared my enthusiasm. If you are in the
            not-so-sure-about-broccoli camp, or are cooking for someone who
            needs to eat more vegetables but is less than enthused at the
            prospect, this is the recipe for you.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large bunch broccoli florets</li>
            <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 cup, packed, torn fresh bread (no crust)</li>
            <li>1/4 grated onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 cup (4 ounces, 114g), packed, grated sharp cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Steam and chop the broccoli:
                Place 1 inch of water in a pot with a steamer basket.
                Bring to a boil. Add the broccoli florets. Steam the
                broccoli florets for 5 minutes, until just tender.
                Rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.
                Finely chop the steamed broccoli florets. You should
                have 2 to 2 1/2 cups.</li>
            <li>Make filling:
                Place the beaten eggs and the torn bread in a large bowl.
                Mix until the bread is completely moistened.
                Add the grated onion, mayonnaise, cheese, lemon zest, salt
                and pepper. Stir in the minced broccoli.</li>
            <li>Distribute broccoli mixture in mini muffin pan wells:
                Preheat oven to 350°F. Coat the wells of 2 mini muffin
                pans (1 dozen wells each) with olive oil (so the bites
                don't stick). Distribute the broccoli mixture in the
                muffin wells.</li>
            <li>Bake:
                Bake at 350°F for 25 minutes until cooked through and
                lightly browned on top.</li>
        </ol>
