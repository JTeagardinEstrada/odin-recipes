        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Comfort food in a bowl.
            From the mild (or hot) flavours
            of Italian sausage, crispy flavourful
            of bacon pieces, hearty chunks of
            tender potatoes, a creamy splash of
            cream, this is the soup to make on
            a cold and miserable day/night when
            you have unlimited garlic bread lying around.</p>

        <p>While Zuppa Toscana translates to
            “Tuscan soup,” this is not a traditional
            soup from the region. Much like a Garlic
            Butter Tuscan Shrimp, Salmon or Chicken,
            this soup was made famous by Olive Garden
            restaurant chains around the Unites states.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 lb mild Italian Sausage (casings removed)</li>
            <li>4 oz (125 g) diced bacon</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine, optional</li>
            <li>1 1/2 quarts (1.5 litres) low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>5 Russet potatoes scrubbed, rinsed and sliced into 1/4-inch slices*</li>
            <li>1 cube beef bouillon crushed</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground fennel</li>
            <li>1 tsp red chili flakes, optional - adjust to your taste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups half and half or heavy/thickened cream</li>
            <li>3 cups chopped kale, hard stems removed (substitute for baby spinach leaves or Swiss chard)</li>
            <li>Fresh shredded parmesan cheese for serving</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cornstarch (optional --for a thicker soup) SEE NOTES</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fry the sausage in a heavy based pot
                or Dutch oven over medium-high heat
                while breaking up the meat with the
                end of your wooden spoon. When browned,
                and cooked through (about 10 minutes),
                drain most of the oil, leaving about 1
                teaspoon of drippings in the pot. Transfer
                sausage meat to a plate.</li>
            <li>Cook the bacon in the same pot/Dutch oven over
                medium heat until crispy (about 10 minutes). Drain,
                leaving about 2 teaspoons of drippings in the pot.
                Transfer cooked bacon to the plate with the sausage meat.</li>
            <li>Sauté onions in the pot and cook until soft and translucent
                (about 5 minutes). Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute,
                until fragrant.</li>
            <li>OPTIONAL: Add the wine and let reduce to half (about 2 minutes).</li>
            <li>Increase heat to high, pour in the chicken broth and bring to a boil.
                Season broth with crushed bouillon, salt, pepper, fennel and chili flakes.
                Add the potatoes and boil until fork tender (about 10 minutes).</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium. Stir in the heavy cream, cooked sausage,
                bacon and kale. Let simmer for 2 minutes, until kale leaves
                have softened.</li>
            <h4>NOTES</h4>
            <p>*For low carb option, replace potatoes with 1 head of cauliflower,
                chopped.</p>
            <p>Cut potatoes into even pieces to ensure even cooking.</p>
            <p>Chicken, turkey or beef sausages can be used.</p>
            <p>Pancetta can be used instead of bacon.</p>
                 
            <p>For a thicker soup, mix cornstarch together with 2 tablespoons
                of cream. Mix well until free from lumps and add it in along
                with the cream. Give it a good stir while the soup is boiling
                until thickened. Then add in the cooked sausage, bacon and kale.
                Continue on with the recipe.</p>
